## Executive Summary

This report details a security analysis of the "ArkieaseAF" software, advertised as an anti-cheat solution for Project Zomboid servers. Based on code analysis and distribution methods, there are significant concerns that this software may be malicious, masquerading as a legitimate anti-cheat solution.
Please refer to the diff between the legitamet game and this "anti-cheat"

## Evidence Collection

### 1. Code Analysis

The provided code diff (allegedly part of the anti-cheat system) reveals:
- Routine maintenance changes to exception handling
- Basic database operation cleanup
- Standard resource management improvements
- No actual anti-cheat functionality

Example of actual changes found in the code:
```java
// Simple error handling modification - no anti-cheat functionality
DatabaseMetaData var3 = var2.m_conn.getMetaData();
ResultSet var4 = var3.getTables((String)null, (String)null, "localPlayers", (String[])null);
```

### 2. Distribution Methods

The software requires users to perform the following actions:

- [ ] Remove all existing mods
- [ ] Replace vanilla Lua files in the "media" directory
- [ ] Replace the core "zombie" folder with their provided version
- [ ] Download additional "optional" files that modify core game components

### 3. Red Flags

#### System Modification Requirements
```plaintext
Required Directory Modifications:
├── ProjectZomboid/
│   ├── media/lua/      # Required replacement
│   ├── zombie/         # Required replacement
│   └── core files      # Multiple modifications
```

#### Suspicious Claims

From their [documentation](https://arkiease.com/ords/r/projectzomboid/arkieasepz/arkiease-af-program):
```text
"This program is an anti-cheat feature of the server, designed to protect 
against cheating and exploiters."
```

Yet the examined code shows no anti-cheat functionality.

### 4. Comparison with Legitimate Anti-Cheat Solutions

| Feature | Legitimate Anti-Cheat | ArkieaseAF |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Core File Modification | ❌ | ✅ |
| Installation Method | Through game client | Manual file replacement |
| Update Process | Automatic | Manual file downloads |
| File Integrity | Preserves original files | Replaces original files |

## Analysis

### Technical Inconsistencies

1. Code Changes:
   - ✅ Exception handling improvements
   - ✅ Resource management cleanup
   - ✅ Database operation optimization
   - ❌ No anti-cheat features

2. Missing Essential Anti-Cheat Components:
   - ❌ Memory scanning
   - ❌ Process monitoring
   - ❌ Network traffic validation
   - ❌ Client-side verification

### Security Implications

The software's requirements raise several security concerns:

1. File System:
   - Replacement of verified game files
   - Modification of core game functionality
   - Manual installation of external files

2. Security:
   - No verification system for replaced files
   - No integrity checking
   - No secure update mechanism

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Malware Distribution | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Critical |
| Data Theft | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Critical |
| System Compromise | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Critical |
| Game Client Damage | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High | High |

## Conclusion

Based on the collected evidence, this software exhibits numerous characteristics consistent with malicious software distribution:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - No legitimate anti-cheat functionality present
   - Basic maintenance code marketed as security features

2. **Distribution**
   - Unsafe installation requirements
   - Unnecessary file modifications
   - Suspicious deployment methods

3. **Security**
   - Multiple critical security risks identified
   - Violation of basic security practices
   - Potential for system compromise

## Recommendations
